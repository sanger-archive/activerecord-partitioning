# ActiveRecord partitioning
This gem enables ActiveRecord to understand partitioned tables in its schema.  At the moment this support is limited to MySQL and,
specifically, the mysql2 connection adapter.  *And, yes, this is very very alpha quality!*

Install with:

    gem "activerecord-partitioning", "~> 0.0.2"

Usage:

    class PartitionMyTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        partition_table('my_table', 'PARTITION BY HASH(id)')
      end

      def down
        raise ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration, "Can't undo partitioning at the moment!")
      end
    end

The second parameter to `partition_table` is simply the MySQL partition statement at the moment, as that's all I needed.

Note that `rake db:schema:dump` will output the `partition_table` call for you.

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

## Update
Updated in March 2016 by Martyn Whitwell to support Active Record 4 and support pseudo-composite primary keys.
